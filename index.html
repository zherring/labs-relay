          <h3>Developing a Richer Financial Reputation</h3>
          <p>
            In this challenge, we want you to rewrite the rules on how we measure an individual’s financial reputation. Disrupt the concept of measuring a person’s credit score, but not their interactions with community, landlords, schools, friends and family.
          </p>
            <p>
              Ask yourself if something like a credit score can be liquidized so it may be shared or used to vouch for someone outside the system.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>How might we derive financial reputation through observable transfer of value?</strong> <br />
                Examples: financial reputation based on projected career earnings, credit score based on wallet transactions, financial reputation derived from in-game spends, etc. <br /> <br /></li>
            <li><strong>How might we leverage credit across groups of people?</strong> <br />
                Examples: a method for pooling co-op resources and reputation to make a major purchase, an open source credit algorithm for a small community or neighborhood, a weighted credit model for marriages, partnerships, and small businesses, etc.
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article id="brief-2" class="briefs">
          <h3> Inventing Double-Opt-In Credit</h3>
          <p> In this challenge, we want you to upend the status quo of credit scores and reputation. Challenge the idea that an algorithm is written by a centralized authority in secret and not shared with applicants in spite of the fact that it’s used to assess whether or not those applicants are “worthy” of access to money.
              What if credit checks were a two-way street? What if we could mitigate or challenge the impact of financial outliers? What if anyone, anywhere could get access to credit and use it?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How might we empower individuals to challenge their credit score?</strong> <br />
              Examples: a decentralized arbitration system, algorithms with openings for write-ins by applicants, “accident forgiveness” for credit history outliers, incentivization structures where lenders’ reputations matter, etc. <br /> <br />
            <li><strong>How might we measure credit as a marketable resource?</strong> <br />
                Examples: credit designed like cash, trading credit, loaning credit to a friend who doesn’t have any, etc.
            </li>

    <h2 class="section-header">Judging Criteria</h2>
    <p> We are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world.</p>
    <p>We expect all bounties to be comprised of two distinct parts: <b>product</b> and <b>potential</b>.  All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.</p>
    <p>As these bounties are broad and left up to your own discretion, we expect you to deliver the following items tailored for your specific solution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A specific industry, user, and use case for which you are solving
        </li>
      <li>Unique insights about the industry gathered through primary or secondary research
        </li>
      <li>Evidence of team-wide entrepreneurial behavior and spirit throughout the Relay
        </li>
      <li>Proof that the market you’ve identified is primed to be disrupted in the next 6-12 months
        </li>
      <li>Testimonial from an industry Subject Matter Expert (SME) who is serving as an advisor
        </li>
      <li>Proof that blockchain adds significant value to this solution over centralized alternatives
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We are looking for participating teams to articulate both broadly and specifically how their proposed solution affects widespread industry orthodoxies. A team that delivers a specific solution must show us how this solution can be rolled out more broadly to impact the industry (or other industries) at large. Conversely, a team that solves in generalities must describe how they anticipate testing their ideas in specific, measurable experiments.</p>

      <h2>Submission Deadline</h2>
      <p>All bounty submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM EDT on April 30th, 2019 to be considered.</p>

      <h2>Judging Date</h2>
      <p>Projects will be assessed from May 1 to May 15th, 2019, and winners will be announced at the Ethereal Conference in New York.</p>
